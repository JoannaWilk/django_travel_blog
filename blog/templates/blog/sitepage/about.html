  My name's Joanna Wilk and I am the author of this site.
  <br />
  <br />
  I am a self-taught aspiring Developer, currently working as a Data Scientist. Starting from Python scripts as a glue for analytical processes, going through analytical process automation using OOP, now I am really excited being on my journey towards Web Development.
  <br />
  <br />
  Next to the passion for coding, I love travels, so it was a natural choice to create blog about my travels as my first website. Regarding technical details, I used Django framework, Bootstrap to spice up the design (however there is still lot to improve in this field ;)) and icons from Font Awesome project.
